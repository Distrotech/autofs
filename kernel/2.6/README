Building the autofs4 kernel module
==================================

To build the module just do the following:

make
make install

The "make install" will make a copy of the original autofs4.ko
and copy the new module. Subsequent "make install" invokations
will not overwrite an existing backup copy. Running "make uninstall"
will restore a backup copy.

An kernel module rpm can be build against the current running kernel
provided that matching kernel header files are present by using:

make rpm

Making a kernel module .deb package has not been completed or tested.
