10/11/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta3
-----------------------------

- I'm aware of one outstanding problem with multi-mount maps. The
  senario is that the daemon cannot remount a manualy umounted multi-mount
  entry until after the following expire event. This is due kernel module
  and daemon not knowing the umount has occured and consequently not
  cleaning up afterward. This causes the kernel module to return a longer
  path than it should which cannot be matched in the map. I hope to be able
  to fix this a some time in the future.
- removed debug print to catch reported mount problem.
- added patch to ignore failed mounts in tree mounts.


14/10/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta2
-----------------------------

- added debug print to catch reported mount problem.
- updated autofs4 patches and their documention.
- added autofs4 patch for 2.4.22.


29/9/2003 autofs-4.1.0-beta1
----------------------------

This is a restructuring and improvement of my original v4 patch which added
direct mount support for file and NIS maps.
                                                                                
As well the considerable restructure and tidy up of my original patch it
includes:
                                                                                
- Merge of all the RedHat autofs v3 patches. This includes the RedHat
  init script and LDAP improvements. See the README files in the package
  for more info.
- Add LDAP direct mount support to complement the file and NIS map direct
  mount support already present.
- Merged some patches from the Debian and SuSE autofs v4 packages.
- Found a bunch of bugs and fixed them. This was largely due to the huge
  efforts made by Aaron Ogden in testing a never ending stream of attempted
  corrections. Thanks Aaron.


29/09/2003 autofs-4.0.0-1
-------------------------

Largely the autofs-4.0.0pre10 with:
- Some patches that I did ages ago to improve submounts. This includes
  correcting the double slash in mount points. Changes to the init script
  to improve the shutdown when submounts are involved.
- Merged some small patches from the Debian and SuSE autofs v4 packages.
- A simple work around to allow tree mounts to work with RedHat 2.4.20,
  and above, kernels in the autofs4 module patch.
