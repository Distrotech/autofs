autofs-5.0.7 - add dumpmap to stdout

The dumpmaps option doesn't allow maps to be output in <key, value>
pairs suitable for use as a file map.

This could be useful to save current maps as a backup for emergency
use.

If the dumpmaps option is given and there is one or more arguments
then consider them map names and output the map in file map format
to stdout.
