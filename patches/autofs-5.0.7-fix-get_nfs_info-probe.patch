autofs-5.0.7 - fix get_nfs_info() probe

A recent contributed patch series changed to behaviour of server
probing to handle port specification to be the same as used by
mount.nfs(8).

Unfortunately, if NFSv2 only is to be probed and the NFS port
needs to be obtained the probe fails unconditionally because
there no rpc client has yet been created.
