autofs-5.0.7 - fix portmap lookup

The autofs RPC library has fallen behind some.

When using IPv6 (rpbbind) version 3 or 4 is available whereas with IPv4
(portmap) verions 2 and 3 are available.

autofs uses the version defined by PMAPVERS in the portmap include files
whereas it should be using the RPCBVERS defines when using libtirpc.

In addition /etc/rpc should be used for program number lookup and
/etc/services should be used to lookup rpcbind/protmap port number.

This incompatibility only shows up when using IPv6 only.
