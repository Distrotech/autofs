autofs-5.0.7 - fix master map mount options matching

The master map options pattern matching is fairly primitive since it
doesn't need to be very sophisticated. The current mount option pattern
matching can't match mount options with quotes or embedded colons and so
it can't pass these options through as a global options string.

But it must be able to match a fairly large class of strings, including
the above case, so they can be passed through as global options. Of
course it can't try and validate them since it can't know what mount type
they may be used with.
