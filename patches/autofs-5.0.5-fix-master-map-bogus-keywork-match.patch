autofs-5.0.5 - fix master map bogus keywork match

If we have a map name in the master map that ends with a keyword
of one of the map types or "multi" we mistakenly match the trailing
white space and include that in the map name. This has to be wrong
since we can't handle quoting in the master map and embedded white
space must be escaped. It would be good if we handled quoted strings
but that has proven a bit of a nightmare so far for the current
tokenizer.
