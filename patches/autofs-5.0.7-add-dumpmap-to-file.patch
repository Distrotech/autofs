autofs-5.0.7 - add dumpmap to file

The dumpmaps option doesn't allow maps to be output in <key, value>
pairs suitable for use as a file map.

This could be useful to save current maps as a backup for emergency
use.

If the dumpmaps option is given and there is an argument it is taken
as a comma seperated list of map names to be output. The given names
must match a existing map name and if so, and the map is available, it
is output to a file of that name unless such a file already exists. If
a file of the name of the map already exists then the map is ignored.
