autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux.  It performs a job
similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
pretending to be an NFS server.  The result is simpler code, better
reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
already mounted.)

An AMD/AutoFS HOWTO is available at:

http://www.Linux-Consulting.com/Amd_AutoFS/autofs.html

... as well as from your favourite HOWTO archive.

To build autofs, please run:

	./configure

to configure the system.  See README.options for options that you can
give configure.

After configuring, you can:

	make			... make the daemon and modules
	make install		... install the daemon and modules

Development kernels 2.3.41 and onwards contain the autofs4 as
standard.  If you're using 2.2, you can apply the patch in
the patches directory; it was made from 2.2.14, but it should
work on 2.2.10 onwards.

A problem with the autofs4 kernel module not expiring mounts
properly and then remaining busy on exit has been seen with
kernels that have the O(1) scheduler patch. Patches that provide
a workaround for this are included in the patches directory.
They are named autofs4-2.4.20-deadlock.patch for standard kernels
that have the O(1) patch iapplied and autofs4-2.4.20-redhat-deadlock.patch
for RedHat kernels that have the patch. It appears that this applies
to RedHat kernels from 2.4.20.

If you use autofs as a module, you need to add "alias autofs autofs4"
to your modules config file (/etc/modules.conf or /etc/conf.modules).

autofs was written by H. Peter Anvin of Transmeta Corporation, please
