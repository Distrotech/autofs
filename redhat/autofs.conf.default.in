#
#	     This configuration option can also be used to
#	     request autofs lookup SRV RRs for a domain of
#	     the form <proto>:///[<domain dn>]. Note that a
#	     trailing "/" is not allowed when using this form.
#	     If the domain dn is not specified the dns domain
#	     name (if any) is used to construct the domain dn
#	     for the SRV RR lookup. The server list returned
#	     from an SRV RR lookup is refreshed according to
#	     the minimum ttl found in the SRV RR records or
#	     after one hour, whichever is less.
