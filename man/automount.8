.TH AUTOMOUNT 8 "12 Apr 2006"
.SH NAME
automount \- manage autofs mount points
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBautomount\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fImaster_map\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBautomount\fP program is used to manage mount points for
autofs, the inlined Linux automounter.  \fBautomount\fP works by
reading the
.nh
.BR auto.master (8)
.hy
map and sets up mount points for each entry in the master map allowing
them to be automatically mounted when accessed. The file systems are
then automatically umounted after a period of inactivity.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-h, \-\-help"
Print brief help on program usage.
.TP
.I "\-p, \-\-pid-file"
Write the pid of the daemon to the specified file.
.TP
.I "\-t, \-\-timeout"
Set the global minimum timeout, in seconds, until directories
are unmounted. The default is 10 minutes. Setting the timeout
to zero disables umounts completely.
.TP
.I "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Enables logging of general status and progress messages for all
autofs managed mounts.
.TP
.I "\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables logging of general status and progress messages as well as
debuging messages for all autofs managed mounts.
.TP
.I "\-Dvariable=value"
Define a global macro substitution variable. Global definitions
are over-ridden macro definitions of the same name specified in
mount entries.
.TP
.I "\-r, \-\-random-multimount-selection"
Enables the use of ramdom selection when choosing a host from a
list of replicated servers.
.TP
.I "\-O, \-\-global-options"
Allows the specification of global mount options used for all master
map entries. These options will either replace or be appened to options
given in a master map entry depending on the APPEND_OPTIONS configuration
setting.
.TP
.I "\-V, \-\-version"
Display the version number, then exit.
.SH ARGUMENTS
\fBautomount\fP takes one optional argument, the name of the master map to
use.
.TP
\fBmaster_map\fP
Location for autofs master map that defines autofs managed mount points
and the mount maps they will use. The default is
.nh
\fBauto.master\fP.
.hy
.RE
.SH NOTES
If the \fBautomount\fP daemon catches a USR1 signal, it will umount all
currently unused autofs managed mounted file systems and continue running
(forced expire).  If it catches the TERM signal it will umount
all unused autofs managed mounted file systems and exit if there are
no remaining busy file systems. If autofs has been compiled with the
option to ignore busy mounts on exit it will exit leaving any busy
mounts in place otherwise busy file systems will not be umounted
and autofs will not exit.
Alternatively, if autofs has been compiled with the option to enable
forced shutdown then a USR2 signal to the daemon will cause all
mounts to be umounted and any busy mounts to be forcibly umounted,
including autofs mount point directories (summary execution). Note
that the forced umount is an unlink operation and the actual umount
will not happen in the kernel until active file handles are released.
The daemon also responds to a HUP signal which triggers an update of
the maps for each mount point.
.P
If any autofs mount point directories are busy when the daemon is sent
an exit signal the daemon will not exit. The exception to this is
if autofs has been built with configure options to either ignore busy
mounts at exit or force umount at exit. If the ignore busy mounts at
exit option is used the filesystems will be left in a catatonic
(non-functional) state and can be manually umounted when they become
unused. If the force umount at exit option is used the filesystems
will be umounted but the mount will not be released by the kernel
until they are no longer in use by the processes that held them busy.
If automount managed filesystems are found mounted when autofs is
started they will be recoverd unless they are no longer present in
the map in which case they need to umounted manually.

.SH BUGS
Don't know, I've fixed everything I know about.

The documentation could be better.
