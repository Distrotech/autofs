.SH NAME
auto.master \- Master Map for automounter
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B auto.master
map is consulted to set up automount managed mount points when the
.nh
.BR autofs (8)
.hy
script is invoked or the
.nh
.BR automount (8)
.hy
program is run. Each line describes a mount point and refers to an
autofs map describing file systems to be mounted under the mount
point.
.P
The default location of the master map is
.nh
.B @@autofsmapdir@@/auto.master
.hy
but an alternate name may be given on the command line when running
the automounter and the default master map may changed by setting the
.nh
.B "MASTER_MAP_NAME"
.hy
configuration variable in
.nh
.B @@autofsconfdir@@/autofs.
.hy
If the master map name has no path then the system Name Service Switch configuration
will be consulted and each of the sources searched in line with the rules
given in the Name Service Switch configuration.
.P
Access to mounts in maps is governed by a key.
.P
For direct maps the mount point is always specified as:
.P
/-
.P
and the key used within the direct map is the full path to the mount point.
.P
For indirect maps access is by using the path scheme:
.P
.RI / mount-point / key 
.P
where
.I mount-point
is one of the entries listed in the master map. The
.I key
is a single directory component and is matched against entries in the
map given in the entry (See
.BR autofs (5)).
.P
Additionally, a map may be included from its source as if it were itself
present in the master map by including a line of the form:
.BR +\ [ maptype , format :] map [ options ]
and 
.BR automount (8)
will process the map according to the specification described below for
map entries.
.SH "FORMAT"
Master map entries have three fields separated by an arbitrary number
of spaces or tabs. Lines beginning with # are comments. The first field
is the mount point described above and the second field is the name of
the map to be consulted for the mount point followed by the third field
which contains options to be applied to all entries in the map.
.P
The format of a master map entry is:
.TP
.IR mount-point\  [ map-type [, format ]:] map\  [ options ]
.TP
\fBmount-point\fP
Base location for the \fBautofs\fP filesystem to be mounted.  For
indirect maps this directory will be created (as with \fBmkdir \-p\fP)
and is removed when the \fBautofs\fP filesystem is umounted.
.TP
\fBmap-type\fP
Type of map used for this mount point.  The following are
valid map types:
.RS
.TP
.B file
The map is a regular text file.
.TP
.B program
The map is an executable program, which is passed a key on the command
line and returns an entry (everything besides the key) on stdout if successful.
.TP
.B yp
The map is a NIS (YP) database.
.TP
.B nisplus
The map is a NIS+ database.
.TP
.B hesiod
The map is a hesiod database whose
.B filsys
entries are used for maps.
.TP
.B ldap \fPor\fB ldaps
The map is stored in an LDAP directory. If \fBldaps\fP is used the
appropriate certificate must be configured in the LDAP client.
.TP
.B multi
This map type allows the specification of multiple maps separated
by "--". These maps are searched in order to resolve key lookups.
.TP
.B dir
This map type can be used at
.BR +
master map including notation. The contents of files under given directory are included
to the master map. The name of file to be included must be ended with ".autofs". A file
will be ignored if its name is not ended with the suffix. In addition a dot file, a file
which name is started with "." is also ignored.
.RE
.TP
\fBformat\fP
Format of the map data; currently the only formats
recognized are \fBsun\fP, which is a subset of the Sun automounter map
format, and \fBhesiod\fP, for hesiod filesys entries.  If the format is
left unspecified, it defaults to \fBsun\fP for all map types except
\fBhesiod\fP.
.TP
\fBmap\fP
Name of the map to use.  This is an absolute UNIX pathname
for maps of types \fBfile\fP, \fBdir\fP, or \fBprogram\fP, and the name of a database
in the case for maps of type \fByp\fP, \fBnisplus\fP, or \fBhesiod\fP or
the \fBdn\fP of an LDAP entry for maps of type \fBldap\fP.
.TP
\fBoptions\fP
Any remaining command line arguments without leading dashes (\-) are
taken as options (\fI\-o\fP) to \fBmount\fP.  Arguments with leading
dashes are considered options for the maps.
.sp
The \fBsun\fP format supports the following options:
.RS
.TP
.I "\-Dvariable=value"
Replace \fIvariable\fP with \fIvalue\fP in map substitutions.
.TP
.I "\-strict"
Treat errors when mounting file systems as fatal. This is important when
multiple file systems should be mounted (`multimounts'). If this option
is given, no file system is mounted at all if at least one file system
can't be mounted.
.TP
.I "nobind"
This is an autofs specific option that is a pseudo mount option and
so is given without a leading dash. It may be used either in the master
map entry (so it effects all the map entries) or with individual map
entries to prevent bind mounting of local NFS filesystems. Bind mounting
of NFS file systems can also be prevented for specific map entrys by
adding the "port=" mount option to the entries.
.TP
.I "\-r, \-\-random-multimount-selection"
Enables the use of ramdom selection when choosing a host from a
list of replicated servers. This option is applied to this mount
only, overriding the global setting that may be specified on the
command line.
.TP
.I "\-w, \-\-use-weight-only"
Use only specified weights for server selection where more than one
server is specified in the map entry. If no server weights are given
then each available server will be tried in the order listed, within
proximity.
.TP
.I "\-n, \-\-negative\-timeout <seconds>"
Set the timeout for caching failed key lookups. This option can be
used to override the global default given either on the command line
or in the configuration.
.SH GENERAL SYSTEM DEFAULTS CONFIGURATION
.P
The default value of several general settings may be changed in the
configuration file
.nh
.BR @@autofsconfdir@@/autofs .
.hy
They are:
.TP
.B TIMEOUT
sets the default mount timeout (program default 600).
.TP
.B NEGATIVE_TIMEOUT
Set the default timeout for caching failed key lookups (program default
60). If the equivalent command line option is given it will override this
setting.
.TP
.B MOUNT_WAIT
Set the default time to wait for a response from a spawned mount(8)
before sending it a SIGTERM. Note that we still need to wait for the
RPC layer to timeout before the sub-process exits so this isn't ideal
but it is the best we can do. The default is to wait until mount(8)
returns without intervention.
.TP
.B UMOUNT_WAIT
Set the default time to wait for a response from a spawned umount(8)
before sending it a SIGTERM. Note that we still need to wait for the
RPC layer to timeout before the sub-process exits so this isn't ideal
but it is the best we can do.
.TP
.B BROWSE_MODE
Maps are browsable by default (program default "yes").
.TP
.B MOUNT_NFS_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL
Specify the default protocol used by mount.nfs(8) (program default 3). Since
we can't identify this default automatically we need to set it in the autofs
configuration. This option will only make a difference for replicated map
entries as availability probing isn't used for single host map entries.
.TP
.B APPEND_OPTIONS
Determine whether global options, given on the command line or per mount
in the master map, are appended to map entry options or if the map entry
options replace the global options (program default "yes", append options).
.TP
.B LOGGING
set default log level "none", "verbose" or "debug" (program default "none").
.SH BUILTIN MAP -hosts
If "-hosts" is given as the map then accessing a key under the mount point
which corresponds to a hostname will allow access to the exports of that
host.
.P
For example, with an entry in the master map of
.nh
.B /net  -hosts
.hy
accessing /net/myserver will mount exports from myserver on directories below
/net/myserver.
.P
NOTE: mounts done from a hosts map will be mounted with the "nosuid,nodev,intr" options
unless overridden by explicily specifying the "suid", "dev" or "nointr" options in the
master map entry.
.SH LDAP MAPS
If the map type \fBldap\fP is specified the mapname is of the form
\fB[//servername/]dn\fP, where the optional \fBservername\fP is
the name of the LDAP server to query, and \fBdn\fP is the Distinguished
Name of a subtree to search for map entries.
The old style
.nh
.B ldap:servername:mapname
.hy
is also understood. Alternatively, the type can be obtained from the Name Service Switch
configuration, in which case the map name alone must be given.
.P
If no schema is set in the autofs configuration then autofs will check
each of the commonly used schema for a valid entry and if one is found
it will used for subsequent lookups.
.P
There are three common schemas in use:
.TP
.I nisMap
Entries in the \fBnisMap\fP schema are \fBnisObject\fP objects in
the specified subtree, where the \fBcn\fP attribute is the key
(the wildcard key is "/"), and the \fBnisMapEntry\fP attribute
contains the information used by the automounter.
.TP
.I automountMap
The \fBautomountMap\fP schema has two variations that differ in the attribute
used for the map key. Entries in the automountMap schema are \fBautomount\fP
objects in the specified subtree, where the \fBcn\fP or \fBautomountKey\fP
attribute (depending on local usage) is the key (the wildcard key is "/"),
and the \fBautomountInformation\fP attribute contains the information used
by the automounter. Note that the \fBcn\fP attribute is case insensitive.
.P
The object classes and attributes used for accessing automount maps in
LDAP can be changed by setting entries in the autofs configuration
located in
.nh
.BR @@autofsconfdir@@/autofs .
.hy
.TP
.B NOTE:
If a schema is given in the configuration then all the schema configuration
values must be set, any partial schema specification will be ignored.
.P
The configuration settings available are:
.TP
.B LDAP_TIMEOUT
Set the network response timeout (default 8).
Set timeout value for the synchronous API  calls. The default is the LDAP
library default of an infinite timeout.
.TP
.B LDAP_NETWORK_TIMEOUT
Set the network response timeout (default 8).
.TP
.B LDAP_URI
A space seperated list of server uris of the form <proto>://<server>[/]
where <proto> can be ldap or ldaps. The option can be given multiple times.
Map entries that include a server name override this option and it is then
not used. Default is an empty list in which case either the server given
in a map entry or the LDAP configured default is used. This uri list is read at
startup and whenever the daemon receives a HUP signal.
.P
This configuration option can also be used to request autofs lookup SRV RRs
for a domain of the form <proto>:///[<domain dn>]. Note that a trailing
"/" is not allowed when using this form. If the domain dn is not specified
the dns domain name (if any) is used to construct the domain dn for the
SRV RR lookup. The server list returned from an SRV RR lookup is refreshed
according to the minimum ttl found in the SRV RR records or after one hour,
whichever is less.
.TP
.B SEARCH_BASE
The base dn to use when searching for amap base dn. This entry may be
given multiple times and each will be checked for a map base dn in
the order they occur in the configuration. The search base list is read
at startup and whenever the daemon recieves a HUP signal.
.TP
.B MAP_OBJECT_CLASS
The map object class. In the \fBnisMap\fP schema this corresponds to the class
\fBnisMap\fP and in the \fBautomountMap\fP schema it corresponds to the class
\fBautomountMap\fP.
.TP
.B ENTRY_OBJECT_CLASS
The map entry object class. In the \fBnisMap\fP schema this corresponds
to the class \fBnisObject\fP and in the \fBautomountMap\fP schema it
corresponds to the class \fBautomount\fP.
.TP
.B MAP_ATTRIBUTE
The attribute used to identify the name of the map to which this
entry belongs.  In the \fBnisMap\fP schema this corresponds to the attribute
\fBnisMapName\fP and in the \fBautomountMap\fP schema it corresponds to the
attribute \fBou\fP or \fBautomountMapName\fP.
.TP
.B ENTRY_ATTRIBUTE
The attribute used to identify a map key. In the \fBnisMap\fP schema this
corresponds to the attribute \fBcn\fP and in the \fBautomountMap\fP schema
it corresponds to the attribute \fBautomountKey\fP.
.TP
.B VALUE_ATTRIBUTE
The attribute used to identify the value of the map entry. In the \fBnisMap\fP
schema this corresponds to the attribute \fBnisMapEntry\fP and in the \fBautomountMap\fP
schema it corresponds to the attribute \fBautomountInformation\fP.
.TP
.B NOTE:
It is essential that entries use class and attribute in a consistent
manner for correct operation of autofs. For example mixing \fBcn\fP and
\fBautomountKey\fP attributes in \fBautomount\fP schema map entries won't
work as expected.
.SH LDAP AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTED AND CERTIFIED CONNECTIONS
LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and certification
may be used by setting appropriate values in the autofs authentication
configuration file and configuring the LDAP client with appropriate
settings.  The default location of this file is
.nh
.BR @@autofsmapdir@@/autofs_ldap_auth.conf .
.hy
If this file exists it will be used to establish whether TLS or authentication
should be used.
.P
An example of this file is:
.sp
.RS +.2i
.ta 1.0i
.nf
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
        usetls="yes"
        tlsrequired="no"
        authrequired="no"
        authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
        user="xyz"
        secret="abc"
/>
.fi
.RE
.sp
If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate Authority
certificate must be set within the LDAP client configuration in 
order to validate the server certificate. If, in addition, a certified
connection is to be used then the client certificate and private key file
locations must also be configured within the LDAP client.
.P
In OpenLDAP these may be configured in the \fBldap.conf\fP file or in the
per-user configuration. For example it may be sensible to use the system
wide configuration for the location of the Certificate Authority certificate
and set the location of the client certificate and private key
in the per-user configuration. The location of these files and the configuration
entry requirements is system dependent so the documentation for your
installation will need to be consulted to get further information.
.P
See \fBautofs_ldap_auth.conf\fP(5) for more information.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
.RS +.2i
.ta 1.0i
.nf
/-	auto.data
/home	/etc/auto.home
/mnt	yp:mnt.map
.fi
.RE
.sp
This will generate two mountpoints for 
.IR /home
and
.IR /mnt
and install direct mount triggers for each entry in the direct mount map
.IR auto.data .
All accesses to
.I /home
will lead to the consultation of the map in
.IR /etc/auto.home
and all accesses to
.I /mnt
will consult the NIS map
.IR mnt.map .
All accesses to paths in the map
.IR auto.data
will trigger mounts when they are accessed and the Name Service Switch
configuration will be used to locate the source of the map
.IR auto.data .
