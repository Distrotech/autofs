.TH AUTOMOUNT 8 "12 Apr 2006"
.SH NAME
automount \- manage autofs mount points
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBautomount\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fImaster_map\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBautomount\fP program is used to manage mount points for
autofs, the inlined Linux automounter.  \fBautomount\fP works by
reading the
.nh
.BR auto.master (8)
.hy
map and sets up mount points for each entry in the master map allowing
them to be automatically mounted when accessed. The file systems are
then automatically umounted after a period of inactivity.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-h, \-\-help"
Print brief help on program usage.
.TP
.I "\-p, \-\-pid-file"
Write the pid of the daemon to the specified file.
.TP
.I "\-t, \-\-timeout"
Set the global minimum timeout, in seconds, until directories
are unmounted. The default is 10 minutes. Setting the timeout
to zero disables umounts completely.
.TP
.I "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Enables logging of general status and progress messages for all
autofs managed mounts.
.TP
.I "\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables logging of general status and progress messages as well as
debuging messages for all autofs managed mounts.
.TP
.I "\-V, \-\-version"
Display the version number, then exit.
.SH ARGUMENTS
\fBautomount\fP takes one optional argument, the name of the master map to
use.
.TP
\fBmaster_map\fP
Location for autofs master map that defines autofs managed mount points
and the mount maps they will use. The default is
.nh
\fB@@autofsmapdir@@/auto.master\fP.
.hy
.RE
.SH NOTES
If the \fBautomount\fP daemon catches a USR1 signal, it will umount all
currently unused autofs managed mounted file systems and continue running
(forced expire).  If it catches the TERM signal it will umount
all unused autofs managed mounted file systems and exit if there are
no remaining busy file systems. If autofs has been compiled with the
option to ignore busy mounts on exit it will exit leaving any busy
mounts in place otherwise busy file systems will not be umounted
and autofs will not exit.
Alternatively, if autofs has been compiled with the option to enable
forced shutdown then a USR2 signal to the daemon will cause all
mounts to be umounted and any busy mounts to be forcibly umounted,
including autofs mount point directories (summary execution). Note
that the forced umount is an unlink operation and the actual umount
will not happen in the kernel until active file handles are released.
The daemon also responds to a HUP signal which triggers an update of
the maps for each mount point.
.P
If any autofs mount point directories are busy when the daemon is sent
an exit signal then the daemon will not exit unless  without umounting the
autofs filesystem.  The filesystem is left in a catatonic
(non-functional) state, and can be unmounted when it becomes unused.

.BR mount (8).
.SH BUGS
A whole slew of things I don't yet know about.

The documentation leaves a lot to be desired.
